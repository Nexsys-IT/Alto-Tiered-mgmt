### 4.3 Tiering/Stubbing Process

**Workflow:**
1. **Pre-flight Checks**

   - Validate file locks and permissions

2. **File Processing**
   - Calculate file hash (SHA-256)
   - Compress file (optional)
   - Encrypt file (optional)
   - Upload to destination storage
   - Verify upload integrity

3. **Stub Creation**
   - Replace original file with stub

   - Preserve file attributes (timestamps, permissions, ACLs)
   - Update central registry

4. **Post-operation**
   - Log operation to audit trail
   - Update metrics and statistics
   - Send notifications (if configured)

**Error Handling:**

   - Identify registry entries without stubs
   - Flag storage objects without stubs

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - File system event watchers
   - Detect stub deletions/moves
   - Update registry immediately

**Orphan Recovery:**

- Retention period after rehydration (before re-tiering)
- Notification preferences
- Access-based triggers (on-open, on-modify, on-read)

**Rehydration Triggers:**
1. **On-Access (Automatic)**
   - User/application opens stub file
   - Driver intercepts and initiates rehydration
   - Transparent to user (with optional delay notification)
   - Subject to customer-defined rules and policies

2. **On-Demand (Manual)**
   - User requests via web UI or CLI
   - Batch rehydration of multiple files
   - Scheduled rehydration
   - Administrator-initiated bulk operations

3. **Policy-Based (Automated)**
   - Seasonal data restoration
   - Project-based bulk restoration
   - Predictive pre-fetching
   - Rule-driven scheduled rehydration

**Rehydration Process:**
1. Retrieve file metadata from stub
2. Download from storage backend
3. Verify integrity (hash check)
4. Decompress and decrypt
5. Replace stub with original file
6. Restore attributes and permissions
7. Update registry and audit log
8. Optional: Keep in cache for future access

**Optimization:**
